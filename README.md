## Quick Start
Currently, this app only supports for Android. I am unable to test the app for iOS platform, since I don't have any apple device.
[Download latest version here.](https://github.com/Daniel-C-J/cipher_dove/releases/latest)



## About Cipher Dove 
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Flutter-02569B?style=for-the-badge&logo=flutter&logoColor=white)"></img>

This project, **Cipher Dove**, is an application intended for the purpose of showcasing my flutter skills... and also for fun.

1) This app is just your another simple basic encryption-decryption application with known and common algorithms, but optimized with certain packages that is fast, and have low memory consumptions. 
2) This app is quite small, around 30MB.
3) This app android `min-sdk` is 21. 


### Architecture

Yeah, after a brief inner-debating, feature-first might be good enough for this project. So this is what it looks like:
```
â”œâ”€common_widgets
â”œâ”€constants
â”œâ”€core
â”‚  â”œâ”€app
â”‚  â”œâ”€local_db
â”‚  â”œâ”€network
â”‚  â”œâ”€theme
â”œâ”€exceptions
â”œâ”€features
â”œâ”€routing
â””â”€util
```


#### Example Feature Structure
```
features/
 â”œâ”€cipher
 â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€data
 â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€domain
 â”‚  â”‚  â””â”€presentation
 ```

The principles here are: 

- **Feature-driven**: Each feature is independent and reusable
- **Domain isolation**: utilities â†’ features â†’ widgets â†’ app
- **Consistency**: Between business logic, UI, and data layers


### Features

Currently this app supports:
- Aes Encryption/Decryption
- Chacha20 Encryption/Decryption
- Md5 Hash
- Sha-1 Hash
- Sha-2 Hash
